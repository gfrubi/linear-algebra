This is _Linear Algebra_ by Jim Hefferon.  The release date is 2019.
You are free to use this material, either under the GNU Free Documentation
license or under a Creative Commons Share Alike license.

Please note that you can buy a hardcopy of this book on Amazon, at a cost that
is less than it would take for me to run it off from the PDF at a local copy 
shop.  (Make sure that you are getting the latest date as there are old versions
also for sale.  The newer version costs the same, and is better.)

For more information, see the web site.

INSTALL

Put book.pdf and jhanswer.pdf in the same directory.  Point your pdf reader
at book.pdf.


COMPILING

Why?

Sigh.  OK.  These instructions are for Linux, Ubuntu 18.  I am the last
person you want giving you advice on how to handle your system so if you
have some other system, such as Mac or Windows, then I cannot help, I'm sorry.

0) Install TeX Live.  You can get it from https://tug.org/texlive/ but
I just did this in a terminal.
  sudo apt-get install texlive-full

1) Clone the linear-algebra archive.  
  cd ~/Documents
  git clone https://gitlab.com/jim.hefferon/linear-algebra.git

Note that the subdirectory is called linear-algebra.  The scripts expect that.

2) Install the luximono font.

  cd ~/Downloads
  wget http://tug.org/fonts/getnonfreefonts/install-getnonfreefonts 
  sudo texlua install-getnonfreefonts
  sudo getnonfreefonts --sys --all

3) Now I can run the shell script that generates the book.  
    cd ~/Documents/linear-algebra
    make
(if it fails with a question mark prompt then probably you get out by
typing `x' and return). 

At the end, you'll have book.pdf and jhanswer.pdf. You could have just
skipped the compiling, you know.

To compile the version that is published in paper, change lines 10 and 11 in
bookjhconcrete.sty to be this.
  \booltrue{hardcopybool}  % uncomment this to make a book for publishing 
  % \boolfalse{hardcopybool}  % the default  
Then run ./make_book_for_web.sh.  You might also want to run this.
