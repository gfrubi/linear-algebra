If you want a hard copy then you can buy one on Amazon at basically
the cost of media; google "amazon hefferon". (Make sure that you are

version costs the same and is better.)

INSTALL

Put book.pdf and jhanswer.pdf in the same directory.  Point your pdf reader
at book.pdf.


COMPILING

Why?

Sigh.  This is what I did for Linux, Ubuntu 18.  If you have some
other system such as Mac or Windows then I am unable to help, sorry.  For that
matter, if you have Linux then I will not help you either, sorry.

0) Install TeX Live.  You can get it from https://tug.org/texlive/ but
I just did this in a terminal.
  sudo apt-get install texlive-full

1) Clone the linear-algebra archive.  
  cd ~/Documents
  git clone https://gitlab.com/jim.hefferon/linear-algebra.git

Note that the subdirectory is called linear-algebra.  The scripts expect that.

2) Install the luximono font.

  cd ~/Downloads
  wget http://tug.org/fonts/getnonfreefonts/install-getnonfreefonts 
  sudo texlua install-getnonfreefonts
  sudo getnonfreefonts --sys --all

3) Now you can make the book.  
    cd ~/Documents/linear-algebra
    make
(If it fails with a question mark prompt then probably you get out by
typing `x' and <return>.) 

At the end, you'll have book.pdf and jhanswer.pdf. You could have just
skipped the compiling.

To compile the version that is published in paper, change lines 10 and 11 in
bookjhconcrete.sty to be this.
  \booltrue{hardcopybool}  % uncomment this to make a book for publishing 
  % \boolfalse{hardcopybool}  % the default  
Then run ./make_book_for_web.sh.  You might also want to run this.
