README for src/lab/fonts

2019-Nov-04 JH  From Linear Algebra by Jim Hefferon

The lab uses the programming font ProggyClean for code, from
https://proggyfonts.net/.  The author is Tristan Grimmer and License.txt
says I can restribute it.

Sage lowers asterisks, so I modified it to a new font ProggyCleanSage,
by moving the asterisk up 350 units.  No other changes.
