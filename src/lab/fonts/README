README for src/lab/fonts

2019-Nov-04 JH  From Linear Algebra by Jim Hefferon
     Nov-05 JH  Copied micto glyph to glyph for Greek mu

The lab uses the programming font ProggyClean for code, from
https://proggyfonts.net/.  The author is Tristan Grimmer and License.txt
says I can restribute it.

Sage lowers asterisks, so I modified it to a new font ProggyCleanSage,
by moving the asterisk up 350 units.  I also copied the micro symbol at
code point 00B5 to the code point 03BC, greek small letter mu, because
Sage mistakenly uses the latter.
