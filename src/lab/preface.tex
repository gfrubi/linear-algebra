This collection supplements the text \nocite{Hefferon12}
\textit{Linear Algebra}.\footnote{The home page of this text, 
\protect\url{http://joshua.smcvt.edu/linearalgebra}, 
has the PDF, the ancillary materials, and the \protect\LaTeX{} source.}
It helps students
solidify and extend their understanding of the subject, 
using the mathematical software \Sage{}.\footnote{See 
\url{http://www.sagemath.org} for the software and documentation.}

A major goal of any undergraduate Mathematics program is to move students 
toward a higher-level, more abstract, grasp of the subject.
For instance, Calculus classes work on elaborate computations
while later courses spend more effort on concepts and proofs, focusing
less on the details of calculations.  
The text \textit{Linear Algebra} fits into
this development process.
It works to bring students to a deeper understanding, 
but it does so by expecting
that for them at this point a good bit of calculation helps the process. 
Naturally it uses examples and practice problems
that are small-sized and have manageable numbers:~an 
assignment to by-hand multiply a pair of three by three matrices
of small integers will build intuition, whereas asking students to do that same 
question with twenty by twenty matrices
of ten decimal place numbers would be badgering. 

However, an instructor can worry that this misses a chance 
to make the point that the subject is widely applied,
or to develop students's understanding through explorations that are not 
hindered by the limitations of paper and pencil. 
Mathematical software can spread the reach of
what is reasonable 
to bigger systems, harder numbers, and longer computations.
This manual's goal is to extends students's abilities in that way.
One advantage of learning how to automate work and
handle larger jobs is that 
this is more like what a student must do when applying Linear 
Algebra to other areas.
Another advantage is that students see new ideas such as 
runtime growth measures.

Well then, why 
not teach straight from the computer?

Our goal is to develop a higher-level understanding of the material. 
So we keep the focus on vector spaces and linear maps.
The exposition here takes computation to be
a tool to develop that understanding, not the main object.

Some instructors will find that their students are best served by
keeping a tight focus on the
core material and leaving aside altogether 
the work here. 
Other instructors
have students who will benefit by using the software.
Because this manual is a supplement, it allows 
teachers to choose what suits their class.


\section{Why \Sage?}
In 
\textit{Open Source Mathematical Software\,} \citep{JoynerStein07}\footnote{The full text of this is at
\protect\url{http://www.ams.org/notices/200710/tx071001279p.pdf}.}
the authors argue that the best way forward for Mathematics 
is to use software that is licensed correctly.

\begin{quotation}\small
Suppose Jane is a well-known mathematician who announces
she has proved a theorem. We probably will believe
her, but she knows that she will be required to produce
a proof if requested. However, suppose now Jane says a
theorem is true based partly on the results of software. The
closest we can reasonably hope to get to a rigorous proof
(without new ideas) is the open inspection and ability to use
all the computer code on which the result depends. If the
program is proprietary, this is not possible. We have every
right to be distrustful, not only due to a vague distrust of
computers but because even the best programmers regularly
make mistakes.

If one reads the proof of Jane’s theorem in hopes of
extending her ideas or applying them in a new context, it
is limiting to not have access to the inner workings of the
software on which Jane’s result builds.
\end{quotation}  
Professionals choose their tools by balancing many factors but
this argument is persuasive.
We use \Sage{} both because it is very capable 
so students can 
learn a great deal from it,
and because it is 
Free\footnote{The Free Software Foundation page 
\protect\url{http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html} 
gives background and a definition.} 
and Open.\footnote{See \protect\url{http://opensource.org/osd.html} 
for a definition.} 



\section{This manual}
This manual is Free.
Get the latest version from 
\url{http://joshua.smcvt.edu/linearalgebra}.\footnote{%
  Also see that page for the license details.}
I am glad to get feedback, especially from instructors
who have class-tested the material.
My current contact information is on the same page.

Also Free are the computer systems that we use to explore the subject,
\python{} and \Sage{}.
Probably your operating system provides these but if not then visit 
\href{http://www.python.org}{\url{www.python.org}}
and 
\href{https://www.sagemath.org}{\url{www.sagemath.org}}.

\textbf{A note on accuracy:}~the examples 
show code for \python{} and \Sage{} and the computer's responses.
To ensure that what you see is what actually happens,
\LaTeX{} grabs the interaction as part of generating this document.  
So what you see should be exact,
unless your software version is very different from mine.
This is my \Sage
\begin{sagecommandline}
sage: version()  
\end{sagecommandline}
and this is my \python{}. 
\begin{pythonconsole}
import sys
print(sys.version)
\end{pythonconsole}




\section{Reading this manual}
Because this supplements the text, 
I don't define all of the terms or prove all of the results.
A student should work through the material here after covering the associated
chapter in the book, using that for reference.

The association between chapters here and chapters in the book is:
\textit{Python and Sage} does not depend on the
book,
\textit{Gauss’s Method} works with Chapter One,
\textit{Vector Spaces} is for Chapter Two,
\textit{Matrices}, 
\textit{Maps}, and 
\textit{Singular Value Decomposition} go with Chapter Three,
\textit{Geometry of Linear Maps} goes best with Chapter Four,
and \textit{Eigenvalues} fits with Chapter Five
(it mentions Jordan Form but only relies on the material up to 
Diagonalization.)

An instructor may want to make up Jupyter notebooks for the chapters here
since they do not have stand-alone exercises.




\section{Acknowledgments}
I am glad for this chance to thank the \python{} and
\Sage{} development teams.
In particular,
without \citep{SageTeam12ref} this work would not have happened.
I am glad also for the chance to mention 
\citep{Beezer11} as an inspiration.
Finally, I am grateful to Saint Michael's College for the 
release time to write this document.
